# Hack Technology / Project Attempted
We learned Unity!

## What you built? 

We built a 3D art gallery with Unity! Neither of us had ever (successfully) used Unity before. The goal was to build a series of rooms that you can walk through (and hear your footsteps) and view different peices of artwork on the walls. We implemented a 3D model, first person character (using the All In One Pack), different surfaces for you to walk on (and different accompanying footstep sounds), put art work on the walls, and finally also included descriptions of the artwork & the artist that appears only when you walk up to the specific piece of art.

Here are some screenshots of our project!

A birds eye view of our 3D art museum:

The welcoming lobby where the game begins:

The first piece of art we added:

Artwork with the matching description script that popped up when we got close to the image:

## Who Did What?

We pair coded and took turns typing as we worked through the tutorial.

## What you learned

We learned a lot about the way Unity organizes different components, and all of the pieces that go into building a VR experience. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to align different planes and determine the orientation that you are looking at the different rooms from. Orienting and putting pictures on the wall was pretty difficult to figure out because you had to determine which way to rotate them based on which wall you wanted to place them on. Our scripts that appear above each piece of artwork and our flooring in each room worked particularly well!
