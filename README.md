# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

Short description of what you attempted to build:
We built a 3D art gallery with Unity! Neither of us had ever (successfully) used Unity before. The goal was to build a series of rooms that you can walk through (and hear your footsteps!) and view different peices of artwork on the walls.

Include some screenshots.
